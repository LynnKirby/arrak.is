More Perfect DOS VGA and Less Perfect DOS VGA are both free for all use,
commercial and non-commercial. IBM designed the glyphs and Zeh Fernando did most
of the work converting them to TrueType, so I don't claim ownership of anything.

If you use either of the fonts in a project, I'd love to hear about it, and I'd
be happy to put a hyperlink to your project on this page if you send me a note:
