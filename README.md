# arrak.is

This is my homepage. Code is a creative endeavor and the code of my homepage
reflects my own desires and feelings. It changes all the time and I'm never
satisfied with it. It's not very pretty because in order to get things done when
expressing myself I have to intentionally make garbage, because garbage is
imperfect but at least garbage exists.

## Source structure

probably delete soon.

`arrak.is` DNS records.

* **`scripts`**: Useful scripts that don't have any other place to go.

* **`src`**: The actual source of my site.

  * **`src/_includes`**: Layouts and partials.

  * **`src/assets`**: Various static files like images.
